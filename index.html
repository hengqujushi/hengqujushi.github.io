        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Yuanyuan Zhang received a B.S. degree from Jilin University in 2012 and has done pioneering work in the
          industry in many leading companies in the track, such as Baidu, Ledongli, Alibaba, and People's Car Service.
          He has accumulated more than 10 years of work in data science and data platforms in mobility data, trajectory
          data,
          and other fields.
          <br />
          <br />
          During my stay at Ledongli, I was independently responsible for the data science work of the first annual
          selected app in the Apple Appstore in China.
          <br />
          <br />
          During my stay at Alibaba, the AI sports product was the first application in the industry to count fitness
          movements in real-time on a mobile phone. During the epidemic, it helped hundreds of thousands of college
          teachers and students successfully carry out physical education teaching and promoted it to tens of millions
          of primary and secondary students; Responsible for the commercial algorithm work of walking and running, with
          an annual income of nearly 100 million yuan.
          <br />
            <br />
            During the People's Car Service period, I led the team in developing an industry-leading SDK and UBI solutions 
            for dangerous driving behavior identification. We applied for 7 patents and published 10 top-tier conference 
            papers, including 8 CCF-A papers. This project became the first in the insurance industry to be selected for 
            the supervision sandbox of the People's Bank of China for financial technology innovation applications. I 
            also led the team in developing the industry's first scalable, high-performance, cloud-native, one-stop 
            <a href="https://github.com/spatialx-project/geolake">geospatial data platform</a>, aiming to address the issue of 
            missing data/AI infrastructure in the field of geospatial data. Currently, I am leading the team in developing
             a full-process agent system for vehicle insurance based on Large Language Models (LLMs).
           <br />
           <br />
           I am deeply passionate about language models (LMs) that are designed to meet a broad spectrum of human needs 
           and center around human-centric concerns. My focus revolves around several critical questions:
           <ul>
           <li>
            <p>How can we develop robust and scalable methods to evaluate LMs, particularly for tasks where human performance is challenging?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What approaches can we employ to create LMs that encapsulate the full spectrum of human desires, including ethical values, 
              personal preferences, and specific competencies?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is it possible to tackle complex issues by enhancing the interactive capabilities of LMs? This enhancement could include 
              augmenting tools and memory, facilitating multi-agent communication, and fostering effective human-AI collaboration.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

           
           I am convinced that these areas of evaluation, alignment, and interaction are interconnected, forming a synergistic loop 
           where each element influences and bolsters the others. My aspiration is to delve into each of these realms not only as 
           isolated topics but also in terms of their interplay, with the ultimate goal of crafting general-purpose language models that are truly human-centric.
            <br />
