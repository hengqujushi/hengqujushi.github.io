        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Yuan yuan Zhang received a B.S. degree from Jilin University in 2012 and has done pioneering work in the
          industry in many leading companies in the track, such as Baidu, Ledongli, Alibaba, and People's Car Service.
          He
          has accumulated nearly 10 years of work in data science and data platforms in mobility data, trajectory data,
          and other fields.
          During his stay at Ledongli, he was independently responsible for the data science work of the first annual
          selected app in the Apple Appstore in China.
          During his stay at Alibaba, the AI sports product was the first application in the industry to count fitness
          movements in real-time on a mobile phone. During the epidemic, it helped hundreds of thousands of college
          teachers and students successfully carry out physical education teaching and promoted it to tens of millions
          of primary and secondary students; Responsible for the commercial algorithm work of walking and running, with
          an annual income of nearly 100 million yuan.
          During the period of the People's Car Service, he led the team to develop the industry-leading SDK and UBI
          solutions for dangerous driving behavior identification, applied for 7 patents, published 2 CCF Class A
          papers, and became the first project in the insurance industry to be selected into the supervision sandbox of
          the People's Bank of China for financial technology innovation applications; He is leading the team to develop
          the industry's first scalable, high-performance, cloud-native, one-stop Spatio-temporal data platform, aiming
          to solve the problem of missing data/AI Infra in the field of Spatio-temporal data.</p>
